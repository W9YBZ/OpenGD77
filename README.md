# OpenGD77
Firmware for DMR transceivers using the NXP MK22 MCU, AT1846S RF chip and HR-C6000 DMR chipset. This includes the Radioddiy GD-77, Radioddity GD-77s, Baofeng DM-1801 and Baofeng RD-5R.

This repo began as a fork of rogerclarkmelborune/OpenGD77, which has since been deleted. It contains the latest known publicly-released code.

# Project status
Development of OpenGD77 appears to have resumed, with firmware and code being released at https://www.opengd77.com/downloads/. The authors have unfortunately chosen not to publish the new code on GitHub. The sole purpose of this repository is therefore to preserve the code.

The firmware generated by this project includes binary code from the official Radioddity firmware. The CODEC from the original binary is re-used to avoid intellectual property infringement. Distributing the resulting binary is therefore problematic from a intellectual property perspective.

# Building
See `BUILD.md` for current build instructions.

- IDE workflow (MCUXpresso + SDK) is documented there.
- Command-line Linux workflow (including codec extraction and `.sgl` output) is also documented there.

# PTT Tone and MDC1200
Sound options now include:

- `PTT Tone`: `Off`, `Beep`, `MDC1200`
- `MDC1200 ID`: 4-hex-digit ID (`0001` to `FFFF`)

Behavior in this implementation:

- `MDC1200` sends one true MDC1200 **POST-ID** burst at **TX end** (EOT).
- MDC1200 TX is **analog-only**.
- MDC1200 is **not sent** on timeout release or during digital TX.
- During MDC TX, CTCSS/DCS is temporarily disabled and restored afterward.
- The MDC burst uses timing-calibrated 1200/1800 Hz symbol scheduling on AT1846 targets.
- `PTT Tone` defaults to `Off` on fresh settings.
- `MDC1200 ID` defaults to the low 16 bits of the configured DMR ID, with fallback `0001` if zero.
